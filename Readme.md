# Escaperoom
Ths was for a school project and probably still has some bugs.<br>
Feel free to make changes and create a PR<br>

# Run
Open your terminal and go into `escaperoom/backend`.<br>
Then run `npm install`

To start the backend: `npm start`

You can just open `frontend/index.html` in a browser for the playerâ€™s view.

But for the admin page you have to use some kind of webserver like [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server)

# A bit of explanation
The player must enter 4 letters or numbers (one for each icon).<br>
You can start a timer in the frontend of 5, 10 or 15 Minutes and the admins can see it.<br>
The admins can change the right code.<br>
The order the symbols for the code: 1: sword 2: eye 3: triangle 4: star
